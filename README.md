# Homework_Week5

In this weeks assignment I added a current time at the top of the page using moment.js 

I added aolumns to be disaplyed correctly on the left and right hand side and implemented certain criteria from the documentation for the save button to be correctly loaded upon loading the screen.

I added a function for the background color depending on what time of the day it is to be displayed correctly with the past present and future parameters.

I added local storage and button functionality when clicking save and reloading the page to have the "reminders" on the planner to be shown.
